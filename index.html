				<h4>Digital Media Technology Coordinator</h4>
				<h4>October 01, 2012 - Present</h4>
				<p>When the website was transfered to the University Relations and Marketing Department I was transfered to that department and my title was changed. I continued working on the website focusing totally on the server backend and programming of all HTML and JavaScript. I also provided analytics and made suggestions to improve <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>. I also supported the in-house programmed "Form Wizard". And managed a Digital Signage Network that grew from eleven screens to twenty.</p>
				<p>During this time the website  redesign began the work of building the process we would use to transfer the content from the old templates to the new ones. I represented the technology side of this descussion. As well as transforming the HTML to the proprietary <abbr title="EXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> based transformational language of our <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.</p>
				<p>As a emmisary between the <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> Department and Marketing I also helped support networking monitoring and various other responsibilities within the IT Department.</p>
